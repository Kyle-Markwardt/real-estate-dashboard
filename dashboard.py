## Streamlit Visualizations

In this section, you will copy the code for each plot type from your analysis notebook and place it into separate functions that Streamlit can use to visualize the different visualizations.

These functions will return the plot or figure for each visualization.

Be sure to include any DataFrame transformation/manipulation code required along with the plotting code.

Return a figure object from each function that can be used to build the dashboard.

Note: Remove any `.show()` lines from the code. We want to return the plots instead of showing them. The Streamlit dashboard will then display the plots.
